There is still much to do to this tool

Some planned features are;

//Add DLC Unlocker
//Add Terminal Window to see what is going on
//Add dropdown menu to open all tools separate from this program
//Add back port tools
//UI Polish

I wanted to drop this before I go silent again for my next semester of school. This is an early build so expect some bugs but as it is right now it will;

Dump the game via FTP and GoldenHen on port 2121

Generate gp4 files 

Build the games from the gp4 files.
